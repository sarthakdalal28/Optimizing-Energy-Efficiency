# Optimizing Energy Efficiency
 ●	Developed machine learning models to predict household electricity consumption, using time-series analysis to enable data-driven decisions for energy savings. Implemented various models including Polynomial Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and CatBoost, with Random Forest achieving the lowest RMSE. ●	Enhanced model insights by integrating findings into a user-friendly interface using the Django framework, facilitating real-time energy consumption predictions to promote efficient energy use and cost savings.
